# NEETscripts
Bash scripts that I use on my Linux box to make it comfier and more versatile.
With them properly set up (Personally I have screenswitcher.sh in the Insert key and ds4audio.sh in the Audio multimedia key, as keybinds in openbox), all my displays and audio devices integrate perfectly and I can switch back and forth between them with just a keystroke. No need to fiddle around with audio or display managers that look like trash on a 10-foot interface anyway.

I thought of just releasing them in case they could be useful to somebody else, and also to have a backup on the cloud.


UPDATE november 2022: i don't even use any of this cr*p anymore lol
except for my now updated switchmon.sh that's a lot better for switching my displays around, it's op
most optimized version of switchmon is on the alternative branch
